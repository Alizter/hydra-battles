The experimental bridge to the [Gaia project](https://github.com/coq-community/gaia) allows now to import some definitions and theorems of the Ketonen-Solovay combinatorial theorems into the Gaia environment (see Chapter 7 of [the documentation](https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf)).

The first topics treated in this version are: canonical sequences, accessibility, and a few rapidly growing hierarchies of arithmetical functions.
