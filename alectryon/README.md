   - Commands
  
       - make Ack.html etc.   (the .html files are put in this directory)    

       
   - Issues
      - In Ack.v, a definition by "Program Fixpoint" is translated into "Fixpoint" alone.
   
      - In the "long line" warnings, the line number (w.r.t. the .v file ?) looks erroneous.

      - At the bottom of the file, some pop-up windows are partially hidden (how to move them upwards ?).
