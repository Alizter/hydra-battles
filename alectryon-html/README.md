# first steps with alectryon



   - Experiments with several coq+rst files. Some long proof scripts are (partially) masked with  ".. coq:: none"; 

         
   - Commands
  
       - make Ack.html etc.   (the .html files are put in this directory)    
       - make all
       
   - Issues
      - In Ack.v, a definition by "Program Fixpoint" is translated into "Fixpoint" alone.
   
      - In the "long line" warnings, the line number (w.r.t. the .v file ?) looks erroneous.
