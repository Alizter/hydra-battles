# Exercises

This directory contains exercises under the form of incomplete coq scripts. You just have to replace the 
**Parameter** commands with  real definitions, and **Admitted** statements with proven lemmas.  

Of course, you are free to add helper functions, additional lemmas, sections, even new libraries if you find it useful.

 
Plase send us your comments, your solutions, and your suggestions of new exercises!
