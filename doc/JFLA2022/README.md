# Changes

## Requested by reviewers

- explain the motivation of a coq_makefile workflow

## Nice to have

- clarify contribution to include:
  - extensions on top of Alectryon for snippet processing and inclusion in LaTeX documents
  - tooling and workflow based on Dune+Docker+Nix+GitHub to continually test and deploy code+book

- link to book files more clearly (ideally not the continuously deployed version, which will change)
