    \begin{itemize}
    \item   We associate a hydra to each ordinal \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\alpha<\epsilon_0$} (in Cantor normal form). For instance, the first hydra of our example is the image of \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\omega^{\omega^2+1}+1$}.
    \item A round (at time $t\in\mathbb{N}$) of a battle transforms an hydra associated with \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\alpha$} into the hydra associated with \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\canonseq{\alpha}{t+1}$}, the $t+1$-st element of the \emph{canonical sequence} of \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\alpha$}.
    \item We want to ``compute'' the length of sequences of the form 
      \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\langle \alpha_k=\alpha,\dots,\alpha_{i+1}=\canonseq{\alpha_i}{i+1},\dots, 1,0\rangle$}, where \textcolor{mathcolor}{$k\in\mathbb{N}$}.
      \item Such sequences are studied
      as \emph{$\alpha$-large sets of natural numbers}  in Ketonen \& Solovay's article
      \emph{Rapidly Growing {R}amsey Functions (1981)}.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Let \textcolor{mathcolor}{$0<\alpha<\epsilon_0$}, and \textcolor{mathcolor}{$i\in\mathbb{N}$}.
      The least index \textcolor{mathcolor}{$k$} such that \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\alpha_k=0$} is  \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H'_\alpha(i)$} where \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H'_\alpha$} is defined by transfinite induction over \textcolor{mathcolor}{$\alpha$}.

      \begin{align}
        H'_0(i) & = i\\
        H'_\alpha(i) &= H'_{(\canonseq{\alpha}{i+1})}(i)  \quad\textit{if $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal}\\
        H'_{\alpha}(i) &=H'_\beta(i+1) \quad\textit{if $\alpha=\beta+1$}
      \end{align}

    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{}
    The \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H'_\alpha$} family,  is a variant of the  \emph{Hardy hierarchy of rapidly growing functions}. For instance, \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H'_{\omega^3+3}(0)\geq2^{2^N}$}, where \textcolor{mathcolor}{$N=2^{70}-1$}.

        \emph{dominates} \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H_\beta$}).

      \item \emph{Proving formally that a given function is not primitive recursive is a nice example of application of a complex (mutually recursive, dependently typed) induction principle. You have to take into account the set of PR functions of any arity.}

    Using  \texttt{PrimRec\_PrimRecs\_ind}, we prove the following lemma:
    
    \begin{quote}
      For any \textcolor{mathcolor}{$n$}, and any primitive recursive function \textcolor{mathcolor}{$f$} of  arity \textcolor{mathcolor}{$n$}, there exists some natural number \textcolor{mathcolor}{$q$} such that the following inequality holds:
      {\color{mathcolor}
        \[
          \forall x_1,\dots,x_n, 
          f(x_1,\dots,\,x_n)\leq\textrm{Ack}(q,\textrm{max}(x_1,\dots,x_n))

  \begin{block}{}

    Instantiating with \textcolor{mathcolor}{$n=1$}, we obtain:

    \begin{quote}
      If \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H'_{\omega^\omega}$} were primitive recursive, there would exists some \textcolor{mathcolor}{$q$} such that, for any \textcolor{mathcolor}{$k$}, \textcolor{mathcolor}{$H'_{\omega^\omega}(k) \leq\textrm{Ack}(q,k)$}, which is false.

    By Lemma \textit{AP\_plus\_closed}, it suffices to prove  $\omega<\omega^2$ and $42<\omega^2$.

  \begin{block}{Remarks}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We could write the book, because we are also the maintainers of the cited \coq source, and could insert the snippet instructions in the \texttt{.v} files. \textcolor{lookcolor}{But what about commenting interesting code from other people (\emph{e.g}
        \gaia) ?}
    \item The same  piece of \coq code may be used in several documents, with different styles (book, beamer), and thus
      different filters (hiding or showing subgoals, hypotheses, etc.).
      
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{To do ?}
    Define a language for
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Searching sentences in any \coq file,
    \item Applying filters in order to generate as many snippets as needed.
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Conclusion and perspectives}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \Hydras wants to provide  a connection between scientific litterature and proof assistant technology:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item For the mathematician, it gives a concrete view of the mathematical contents: full proofs, examples, computable functions whenever possible, etc.
        \item  For the \coq learner, it provides a consistent set of examples,
allowing to present and compare various formalization and proving techniques.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \end{frame}

  \frametitle{Perspectives}
  \begin{block}{Library on ordinals}
    There exist already \coq libraries which formalize ordinal numbers.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \gaia (José Grimm) : Formalization of Bourbaki's Elements of Mathematics. {\color{lookcolor}\emph{This library uses an ordinal representation compatible with ours. It is  written in SSreflect/Mathcomp, and is also maintained on \community}.}
    \item A formalization by Minki Cho, using a different representation.
{\color{darkorange}
\begin{verbatim}
Inductive Ord.t :=
| Ord.build: 
    forall (A: Type), (A -> Ord.t) -> Ord.t.
\end{verbatim}
}  
    \end{itemize}

    Both libraries contain set-theoretical results about larger ordinals than ours. Having a library containing both our combinatorial results (large sets and rapidly growing functions) and mathematical definitions of ordinals would be an interesting project.
