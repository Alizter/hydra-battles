\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}
Hydra games (also known as \emph{Hydra battles}) appear in an article published in 1982 by two mathematicians, 
Laurie Kirby and Jeff Paris: \emph{Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic}~\cite{KP82}.
This article describes a game between two players: Hercules and a hydra.
A short description  can be found in Andrej Bauer's blogpost~\cite{bauer2008} as well as a simulator~\cite{BauerHydra}.
In a few words:
\begin{itemize}
\item A hydra is a finite tree, traditionnaly presented with the root at the bottom, the leaves of which are called \emph{heads}
  (Fig~\vref{fig:iota-example}).
\item At every round, Hercules chops off one head of the hydra. If the head is at a distance greater or equal than 2 from the root,
  then some sub-tree $h$ of the hydra is copied a certain amount $i$ of times. The number $i$ of copies and the copied sub-hydra $h$ may depend of the considered variant of the game
  or the time elapsed since the beginning of the fight.
\end{itemize}

Kirby and Paris prove the following theorems, applying
combinatorial results about ordinal numbers by Jussi Ketonen and Robert Solovay~\cite{KS81}.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[$(1)$] In the Hydra game, every strategy is a winning strategy for Hercules.
  \item[$(2)$] The theorem $(1)$ cannot be proved in Peano Arithmetic.
\end{description}
\end{quote}

The contrast between the simplicity of the statements above and the complexity of their proofs convinced us that it is a good thema for a commented library of formal proofs.


\begin{itemize}
\item We present complete proof scripts for the \textit{Coq} proof assistant~\cite{Coq}. These scripts may consulted and replayed by the reader.
\item Complex formalisations and proofs are explained in an
  electronic book~\cite{HydraBook}. Whenever various reasonable choices exist, we try to present and compare the alternatives.
  For instance, Figures~\vref{fig:Ex42E0} and \vref{fig:Ex42-schutte} show two radically different proofs of the equality
  $\omega+42+\omega^2=\omega^2$, the first one is a simple proof by computation, the second one shows how this equality
  is a consequence of the axioms of the set-theoretic model  by Kurt Schütte~\cite{schutte}. 
\item
  Reciprocally, we provide ``concrete'' examples of several formalisation and proof techniques: operational type classes, functions defined by  equations, dependently typed functions, etc.
\item It may be used as a library on ordinal numbers, for instance for proving termination properties.
  \end{itemize}

 Prior stages of this project have already been presented at
 JFLA~\cite{PCiota, JFLA2018paper}.
We present the recent evolutions of the library: new results, interaction within the Coq-Community project~\cite{CoqCommunity}, and documentation generated with Alectryon~\cite{alectryonpaper, alectryongithub}.

\section{New results}
In order to make evident how long a hydra battle can be,
one may consider a deterministic variant of the game,
``compute'' the number of steps of the battles, and thus obtain a minoration of the general case.

The variant we consider is the same as 
in~\cite{KP82, bauer2008, BauerHydra}. 


 \begin{itemize}
 \item The game starts at an arbitrary initial step $i\in\mathbb{N}$.
   
   \item The hydra grows $n$ copies at step $n$ of the game.
   \item  The initial hydra is the graphical representation of an ordinal  $\alpha<\epsilon_0$  in Cantor normal form (See for instance Fig~\ref{fig:iota-example}). This property is an invariant of the game.
 \item Hercules always chops off the rightmost head of the hydra (which is always one of the lowest heads).
 \end{itemize}
 It mathematical terms, if at step $n$ the hydra is associated with the ordinal $\alpha$, at step $n+1$ it is associated with
 $\canonseq{\alpha}{n+1}$, the $(n+1)$th element of the canonical sequence of $\alpha$~\cite{KS81}.
 
 



Let $\alpha<\epsilon_0$ be an ordinal.
Using the \texttt{coq-equations} plug-in~\cite{sozeau:hal-01671777}, we define the function which returns the number of steps of the battle starting with $\alpha$ at step $i$ for  any $i\in\mathbb{N}$.
We prove that this number is greater or equal than
$H'_\alpha(i)-i$, where $H'$ is a slight variant of the Wainer Hardy hierarchy of rapidly growing functions~\cite{BW85, KS81, Promel2013, Wainer1970}, defined by transfinite recursion in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hprime}.


\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{itemize}
\item If $\alpha=0$, then $H'_\alpha (i)= i$ for any natural number $i$.
\item If $\alpha=\beta+1$, then 
$H'_\alpha(i)=H'_\beta(i+1)$ for any $i \in \mathbb{N}$.
\item If $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal, then 
$H'_\alpha(i) = H'_{(\canonseq{\alpha}{i+1})}(k)$ for any $i\in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{4pt}
\inputsnippets{Hprime/HprimeDef}
\caption{The rapidly growing hierarchy $H'$ of arithmetic functions}
\label{fig:Hprime}
\end{figure}

\label{sect:not-pr}
From this result, we infer that the considered function is not primitive recursive in general (for $\alpha\geq\omega^\omega$).


 
\section{Main features}




\subsection{The Coq-Community ecosystem}
\begin{todo}
Small presentation.
\end{todo}

In order to prove formally that the length of the considered
kind of battles is not given by a primitive recursive function, weused the formalisation of primitive recursive functions, part
of Russell O'Connor's contribution on G\"{o}del first incompleteness theorem \cite{OConnor05, Goedel}.
For this purpose, and above all by consideration of the scientific interest of this contribution, we chose to host and maintain this work within \textit{Coq-Community}.

Computability is a key topic in Computer Science teaching. Moreover O'Conor's library is a nice illustration of dependently typed programming, so we chose to devote a full chapter to this formalisation, with comments on the definitions and proofs, [counter]-examples and exercises.


\subsection{Documentation with Alectryon}
\begin{todo}
  Interest of Alectryon:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Despite the frequent changes (improvements) in the Coq scripts, code inclusion and \textit{Coq}'s answers are up to date.

  \item Presentation of the main steps of proofs, possibly interleaved with text (Figures \vref{fig:Ex42E0} and \vref{fig:Ex42-schutte}).
    
  \end{itemize}
\end{todo}

  Let us prove again the equality $\omega+42+\omega^2= \omega^2$. Let us recall that $\omega^2$ is an abbreviation of $\phi_0(2)$,
\emph{i.e} the third  additive principal ordinal.

\inputsnippets{Schutte/Ex42a}


Our proof is very different from the computational proof of Fig\ref{fig:Ex42E0}.
By definition of additive principal ordinals, 
it suffices to prove the inequality $\omega+42< \phi_0(2)$.

\inputsnippets{Schutte/Ex42b}

Since the set \textit{AP} of additive principals  is closed under addition
(by Lemma \textit{AP\_plus\_closed}), it suffices to prove the inequalities $\omega<\phi_0(2)$ and $42<\phi_0(2)$.

\section{Conclusion and perspectives}

\begin{todo}
  Work destined both to Coq-users and people interested in discrete math ?
 \end{todo}


\subsection{Perspectives}


The Gaia project~\cite{Gaia}, also maintained on \textit{Coq-Community} contains a development by José Grimm~\cite{grimm:hal-00911710}. This library -- dedicated  to the implementation in \textit{Coq (SSreflect)} of books from  Bourbaki's Elements of Mathematics --- contains a generalization of two types of ordinals (\texttt{T1} for the ordinal $\epsilon_0$ and
\texttt{T2} for $\Gamma_0$) to a larger ordinal defined by Ackermann, and relates these data structures with Bourbaki's set theory.
It is interesting to note that both libraries \textit{Gaia} and \textit{hydra-battles} contain their own (isomorphic but not identical) definitions of types \texttt{T1} and \texttt{T2}, both originated in~\cite{CantorContrib}.
Our plan is to build a  ``gate'' giving access to both the combinatorial results of \textit{hydra-battles} and the set-theoretic content of \textit{Gaia}, and make possible the transfer of theorems from one of the two libraries to the other one.

Another direction would be to write in \textit{Coq} a formal proof of the original statement of the second theorem of Kirby and Paris. For this purpose, we plan to import  the formalization of Peano Arithmetic by O'Connor~\cite{Goedel}.
